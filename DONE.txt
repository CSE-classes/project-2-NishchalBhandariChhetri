Project Status: 100% Complete

Implementation Details:
- Modified growproc() in proc.c to support lazy page allocation
- Implemented page fault handler in trap.c for on-demand allocation
- Lazy allocator only updates virtual address space in sbrk()
- Physical pages allocated on first access via page faults
- Proper error handling for allocation failures and illegal accesses
- Both DEFAULT and LAZY allocators work correctly

Test Results:
All 6 test cases pass successfully:
✓ Test 1: sbrk(10) - No physical allocation with lazy allocator
✓ Test 2: Write to valid range - Physical pages allocated on access
✓ Test 3: Heap increase/shrink within same page
✓ Test 4: Multiple page allocation/deallocation
✓ Test 5: Allocation over limit - Proper error handling
✓ Test 6: Write above program break - "Unhandled page fault!"

Code compiles without warnings and runs correctly in QEMU.
